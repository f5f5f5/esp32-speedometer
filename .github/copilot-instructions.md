# ESP32 Speedometer - AI Agent Instructions

This document provides essential guidance for AI coding agents working with the ESP32 Speedometer project. This project implements a speedometer using a Waveshare ESP32-S3 with a round screen display, GPS module, and rechargeable battery.

## Project Overview

The ESP32 Speedometer is an embedded system that:
- Uses a Waveshare ESP32-S3 development board with round screen display
- Integrates with a GPS module for speed and location data
- Powered by a rechargeable battery system
- Displays real-time speed information on the round screen

## Key Components

1. Hardware Components:
   - Waveshare ESP32-S3 board with round screen
   - GPS module
   - Rechargeable battery

2. Core Functionality:
   - GPS data processing
   - Speed calculation and display
   - Battery management
   - Round screen UI rendering

## Development Status

This appears to be a new/early-stage project based on the minimal repository content. When contributing:

1. Follow embedded systems best practices:
   - Consider memory constraints of ESP32-S3
   - Optimize for battery efficiency
   - Handle hardware initialization and error states

2. Code Organization:
   - TBD as project structure develops
   - Expected future separation of concerns between GPS, display, and power management
